An informal journal of some thoughts, doubts, ideas, TODOs, etc.

## Currently still black magic
* **Cholesky decomposition**: both *how* the composition
    works, and *why* it works.
* **Shrinkage estimator**: computation is straightforward,
    but why is inverting a normal sample covariance matrix $\Sigma$
    instable, and why does this help?
* **The DQN variant used**: the paper doesn't describe it.
    But it seems some complicated RNN version
    with an *'actor'* and a *'learner'*.
